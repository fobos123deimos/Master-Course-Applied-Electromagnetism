## Task 3

### Problem 01
A uniform plane wave with a frequency of 10 GHz is incident normally on a dielectric plate of thickness d and is bounded on both sides by air. Assume that the dielectric constant of the plate is 3.7.

> **(a)** Determine the thickness of the plate so that the input reflection coefficient at 10 GHz is zero. And if the wave is incident with 20 GHz and, in fact, the input reflection coefficient at 20 GHz is also zero.
>
> **(b)** Plot the magnitude of the reflection coefficient as a function of frequency for 5 GHz $\le$ f $\le$ 30 GHz when the dielectric plate has a thickness of 0.9375 cm, for the two cases: $f_{0}$ = 10 GHz and $f_{0}$ = 20 GHz.

### Problem 02
A uniform plane wave is incident normally on a dielectric plate whose thickness at $f_{0}$ = 10 GHz is  $\lambda_{2_{0}}/4$, where $\lambda_{2_{0}}$ is the wavelength in the dielectric plate. The plate is bounded on the left side by air and on the right side by a semi-infinite medium with a dielectric constant $\epsilon_{r_{3}}$ = 5.7

> **(a)** Determine the intrinsic impedance $\eta_{2}$ and the dielectric constant $\epsilon_{2}$ of the sandwiched plate such that the input reflection coefficient at $f_{0}$ = 10 GHz is zero. Do the same for $f_{0}$ = 20 GHz
>
> **(b)** Plot the magnitude response of the input reflection coefficient for 5 $\le$ f $\le$ 30 GHz when the intrinsic impedance and physical thickness of the plate are those found in part 1.
>
> **(c)** Using the ray-tracing model from Figure 5-11, at $f_{0}$ = 10 GHz and $f_{0}$ = 20 GHz, determine the first and the next two higher-order terms contributing to the overall input reflection coefficient. What is the input reflection coefficient using these three terms?
